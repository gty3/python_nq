<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gty3/dom-img/main/nq_1s_2m.png)

This project serves as an educational experiment. It analyzes trading activity among the 100 stocks that comprise the Nasdaq 100 and creates a dataframe of trades based on NQ bid/ask. This dataframe is then overlayed on a candlestick chart.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To run the Jupyter notebook, you'll need an appropriate environment.
I'm using Visual Studio Code with the Jupyter extension. 

You will need an API key from  [Databento](https://databento.com/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gty3/python_nq.git
   ```
2. Open the project with your choice of Jupyter platform.
3. Rename `env.example` to `.env` and add your DATABENTO_API_KEY

4. Open main.ipynb and select Run All.
  
    You will need to have python installed.





<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
The trades are limited to 1 per second, plotting will fail if otherwise. Be sure to use trading hours data
The project is divided into 4 cells. 

Cell 1 imports 3 datasets using the [get_range](https://databento.com/docs/api-reference-historical/timeseries/timeseries-get-range?historical=python&live=python) method:
- The first 2 datasets use the "tbbo" schema - "Top of Book Bid and Offer". While the order book data is necessary for logging the NQ trade prices, it is not necessary for the underlying instruments orders. However, as these datasets are merged, it enables more concise code.
- The 3rd dataset uses the "ohlcv-1s" schema to create our candlestick chart in cell 4.

<br/>

Cell 2 implements the trading logic for the algorithm.
It aggregates the number of buys and sells across the 100 underlying instruments each second.
- If the trade condition is met, log the nq bid/ask price in the trades dataframe.
- The `modify_trades` function removes trades that do not conform to one contract open.
- The `calculate_pnl` function adds a current trade and total profit & loss.

<br/>

Cell 3 uses `dtale` to view the trades dataframe. This is a great tool to visualize the dataframe while modifying the code. 

<br/>

Cell 4 creates a candlestick chart using `mplfinance`, overlaying a buy and sell dataframe, split from the previous dataframe, on a ohlc dataframe chart.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Simulate network latency.
- [ ] Add a stop loss. 
- [ ] Add max duration to a trade.
- [ ] Use live data.
